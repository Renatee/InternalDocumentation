* Membership: Where does the money go:

  Riaan reports:

  * Added basic content, check if it is okay like that.
  * Should we add method to become a member text - pay to our account and send us reference with name, surname and e-mail address? Company / personal link?

  Contact list with e-mails, names only published.

Attendance Register for Meet-ups
--------------------------------
*≈ 15 min*

In stead of an attendance register we will use meetup.com. This will require serious push at meet-ups to make sure people have registered with meetup.com and regularly subscribe to events.

At meet-ups during the go-around to introduce one self we'll verify people marked themselves as coming to the meet-up and for the first three that have not, assist them in doing so right there and then.

Links on dasa.org.za will link to the meetup.com events.

Robin to bring the Cape Town guys up to date with this.
