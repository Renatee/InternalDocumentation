Riaan reports: Visited Adam at Business Connection on Wed 25 Jun. Venue is
perfect and includes AV equipped Auditorium for 250, 2 medium boardrooms ideal
for BoF sessions (≈ 10 seated and 20 standing), 2 smaller boardrooms, ample safe
parking, careering facilities with good food and loads of space for the hallway
track.

Riaan reports: Drew up the speculative schedule, but it would appear to be a lot
more work than can be covered at the existing DASA meetings and may involve more
or different people. Perhaps we can arrange another Wednesday of the month for
DrupalCamp planning?

Notes:
* Adam suggests having BCX speak about Cloud services, perhaps with Drupal sites.
