DCJHB'15
========

Venue
-----
*≈ 5 min*

Once we have a firm date we can confirm Business Connection, Midrand. Venue is
perfect and includes AV equipped Auditorium for 250, 2 medium boardrooms ideal
for BoF sessions (≈ 10 seated and 20 standing), 2 smaller boardrooms, ample safe
parking, catering facilities with good food and loads of space for the hallway
track.


Dates & Times
-------------
*≈ 30 min*

### Dates

* Should we do two (CT and JHB) or one camp per year alternating cities?
* We need an early, firm date to book speakers and secure the venue.
* The earlier suggested date of **Saturday the 7th of March** may be too early
  if we cannot:
  * devote more time in-between meetings to discuss and execute on stuff
    virtually,
  * have a dedicated additional Wednesday meeting per month for DCJ and/or
  * bring additional portfolio holders and/or volunteers on board.
* It is a great date though! So perhaps we should postpone anything that can
  hold up the time frames for DCJHB to the DCCT. By March students are nicely
  back to work, the year is in full swing and people don't remember the
  financial drain that the December holidays caused, but are still inspired to
  find new opportunities to more the next December more affordable, it's before
  April's holidays and it's not all that cold yet.

Tasks:

* Decide on frequency.
* Decide on how we want to plan planning.
* Decide on whether we should have a planning committee.
* Decide on a date or a date to decide on a date.
* Write actionable tasks here for specific people if needed.
* Discuss with Cape Town if they are keen to put together a mini-camp. 

Notes:

Completed / Agreed: ✔ / ✘

### Times

I've attended a few conferences of late and they all do start indecently early
without the lack of attendance due to the early time that I expected. So perhaps
it may be a good idea to start earlier than this suggested programme:

Schedule

    (AU) Auditorium (250 people seated, maybe another 50-80 standing)
    (B1) Boardroom 1 (10 seated, maybe 15-25 standing)
    (B2) Boardroom 2 (10 seated, maybe 5-8 standing)
         Unconfirmed Classrooms (30 seated, maybe 10-15 standing)
    (HT) Hallway Track
    (GZ) Gazebo

Topical Matters:

    (B) Business
    (F) Front End
    (O) DevOps
    (D) Development
    (I) Implementation
    (-) Other (Keynote, Community, Drupal 8, Closing / Group Photo)

* Fill up for 15min, speak for 45min.

Stagger topics so that there's something to stay for for everyone, maybe we can
start an hour earlier?:

    11:00   AU:- (Keynote)
    12:00   AU:B   B1:F   B2:O
    13:00   AU:F   B1:O   B2:D
    14:00   Lunch
    15:00   AU:O   B1:D   B2:I
    16:00   AU:D   B1:I   B2:-
    17:00   AU:I   B1:-   B2:B
    18:00   AU:- (Closing followed by Group Photo)

    19:00 / 20:00
    After Party with speakers, say at Cobblestones Monte.

* If we have some shorter talks that match, say Sass and Less ones or Grunt and
  Gulp ones, we can bundle them in an hour with two speakers.
* A business show-and-tell may work well with one presenter inviting several
  speakers to each give a 10min talk.
* Boardrooms can be used for Birds of a Feather when speakers are not available
  and can also function like more topic-specific guided conversations similar to
  meet-ups.

If attendance is low, the hallway track won't be as happening as some
DrupalCamps, if attendance is high even the keynote will be skipped by many and
only watched afterwards on downloads or if shown on screens in the hallways. We
can therefore probably accommodate 300 to 400 people and in a pinch even 500.
From my DrupalCon and even nightclubs experience, more than half the people
don't partake at any one time in the actual presentations (or live bands) and
prefer to communicate in the hallways and on the lawns. This is more true for
well-attended events with more opportunity interpersonal connections.

Tasks:

* Discuss the proposed schedule and make notes on discussion.
* Assign early talks or people we know we can invite to talk as tasks.
* Write actionable tasks here for specific people if needed.

Notes:
* Adam says we need to be out the venue by 5. Adjust timelines to reflect 9am - 3pm

Completed / Agreed: ✔


Speakers
--------
*≈ 15 min*

* Promote national representation by considering sponsored travel for people not
  from Johannesburg. Identify and invite people from at least also Cape Town and
  Durban.
* While open voted-for sessions may be an ideal, it may be too administratively
  onerous... perhaps for the DCJHB'15 we should invite generally, consider such
  submissions and also invite specifically.
* We should urge speakers to prepare off-line slides and ideally, GitHub based
  JS slides that we will make off-line copies of. On the day the internet isn't
  likely to be fast.

Speakers:

* General speakers from previous meetups (Ivan, Greg, Riaan, Jason Legodi, Lee, Lancelot)
* Adam suggests having BCX speak about Cloud services, perhaps with Drupal sites
  which will require an assigned experienced Drupal user from us to advise them.
* Michael Needhamm (CT)
* Renate has confirmed her availability to be a speaker
* Mark Theunisen (Pantheon) (DBN)
* André Ellis
* TODO: Cape Town and Durban Speakers

Tasks:

* Riaan to contact a few international luminaries for tentative talks once we're
  okay with our website.
* Put out a call on G.D.o/SA to ask for speakers to nominate themselves.

Notes:

Completed / Agreed: ✔


Promotion / Advertising
-----------------------
*≈ 15 min*

* Magazine advertising is expensive; May be best to target people with Google
  advertising if we do advertise.
* Radio advertising is also viable. 
* Attend Linux user-groups, node.js groups, etc.

Sponsored Attendance

* Sending one or two sponsored tickets to schools with IT departments will
  definitely fill us up nicely with the top IT students also fulfilling our
  mandate to promote Drupal. We'll have to cover the cost of catering.
* Similarly, sponsoring universities with some free attendance for students will
  add more interested and skilled new attendees to introduce to Drupal.
* Sponsorships can help and attendance ticket prices can be set at the cost for
  catering for two or 2.5 people thus covering the cost for sponsored
  attendance.
* Such sponsorship will be much more direct, targeted and effective in terms of
  marketing.

Tasks:

* Robin to make some nice DASA CI for tickets, printables etc.

Notes:
* Adam will get a menu for catering costs, so that we can work out sponsorship costs, etc.

Completed / Agreed: ✔ 


Sponsorship
-----------
*≈ 25 min*

Based on discussions in the past on GDoSA, we should try not to leave anyone out
or focus on a single sponsor. With that in mind, perhaps this will be a good
structure:

Up to 5 Primary/**Platinum** sponsors: R 50 000 / sponsor

* Comes with 12 free tickets
* Opportunity for universities and enterprise Drupal users
* Allowance for one on stage far-on-the-sides roller-banner at own cost
* Allowance for one curved wall banner at entrance at own cost
* Allowance for four sharkfins outside at own cost
* Printed sponsorship logo (larger) on front of programme
* May place printed advertorial material at entrance (front row)
* May place any amount of printed material and stickers in the conference bag
* May co-brand (with DASA CI) additional sponsored corporate gifts numbering 500
  or more pens, USB sticks, T-shirts, badges, stickers, keyrings
* One free first choice of hour of the Jobs Gazebo
* Banners and fins to show DASA/DrupalCamp CI over 10% of presentation space

Any number of Secondary/**Gold** sponsors: R 8 000 / sponsor

* Comes with 4 free tickets
* Allowance for one roller-banner at entrance at own cost
* Allowance for one sharkfin outside at own cost
* Banners and fins to show DASA/DrupalCamp CI over 10% of presentation space
* May place printed advertorial material at entrance (second row)

Any number of Tertiary/**Bronze** sponsors: R 1 500 / sponsor

* Printed name (smaller) on back of programme
* May place a printed A5 advertorial material at entrance (last row)
* Comes with 1 free ticket

**Individual** top sponsors: R 500

* Name and link (to GDo profile) on web only (listed first)

**Individual** supporting sponsors: R 350

* Name and link (to GDo profile) on web only (listed second)

Jobs gazebo for employers looking for staff to talk and meet job seekers.

* R 15 000 for an hour booking if available.
* Anything can be handed out here.
* Will be outside by the entrance if not raining, inside if raining.
* 3x3m DASA-branded Gazebo
* If the Gazebo is fully booked, we can always get a second one ;-) or:
  * Own Gazebo with 10% space co-branded with DASA for the full day: R 30 000 -
    cost of Gazebo for not included (R 9 000).

DASA governing board members will not take sponsorship slots within the first
month of sponsorship being promoted and made available to the rest of the
community. The community comes first.

Unused sponsorship money will go to DASA.

Tasks:

* Write actionable tasks here for specific people as needed.

Notes:

Completed / Agreed: ✔

Ticketing
---------
*≈ 15 min*

Some early estimates:

* Early bird: R 300 (buy in 2014)
* Regular: R 400 (buy before end of Feb)
* Late: R 500 (before day of event)
* On the day: R 600 (day of event)

Students can apply for sponsored attendance (if invitations we sent to schools
and varsities are not taken up).

This will allow us to sell up to 200 tickets and sponsor another 200. Overflow /
urgent may in a pinch take this up to 500.

Tasks:

* Look at quicket to sell tickets for us.
* Review pricing once we have cost structures.

Notes:

Completed / Agreed: ✔ / ✘

Costs
-----
*≈ 20 min*

**Note** Very speculative!

* Catering
  Adam will let us know.
* Sundries
  Paper and pens ;-) Yup, we'll need em.
* Printing
  * Programmes, notes for speakers that prepare them for us.
  * Roller Banners (2 x R 1 000)
  * Sharkfins (6 x R 1 300) (directs people the last mile)
  * Conference name tags
  * Gazebo (branded) (1 x R 9 000)
  * Most of this can be used again.
* Staff
  * Volunteers
    Admin helper may need funding: for example, managing the payments and
    tickets for up to 500 people isn't light volunteer work.
    AV guys may need some pay - it can be gruelling.
    Some others may need some student pocket money - sign in etc.
* Swag
  * Stickers (plenty)
  * Pins
  * Speaker Pins
  * T-shirt (maybe sold, not free)
  * Swag bag (Branded Accentuate Conference Tote) R 35 / bag
  * Maybe notebook and pen (works great at other conferences).
* Sponsorhip (travel, food, residence, speaker cost)
* Advertising

* **We need to bring this together into a budget as early as possible!**

Tasks:

* Write actionable tasks here for specific people as needed.

Notes:

Completed / Agreed: ✔


General
-------
*≈ 20 min*

* We need to think of some big start and big end events, and perhaps swag
  handouts at those times. This will keep people there for the full experience.
* If we get a good uptake of valid and enthusiastic students, we may want to try
  to arrange for the use of the classrooms at the BCX facility. Their
  availability is by no means assured.
* Video capture and upload, super fast (need non-Drupal guys to help else the
  Drupal-guy, likely Lee, will miss some cool shit). Along the same lines, if
  we're central to the operation and discourse of the day, we need volunteers or
  paid for students to handle administration so that we can contribute the the
  actual hall track, eventualities and speakership. 
* We need a cat herder or two for speakers, boardrooms and staff.

Tasks:

* Please, everyone, ensure you complete your tasks. Especially for the costs that are required to build an event like this.
