Drupal User Group Meet-ups
==========================


Johannesburg
------------
*≈ 20 min*

Topics:

* Continue discussion on assistance given to national meet-ups to help build
  a medium-term schedule of upcoming talks that can be published and promoted
  so that people know which they want to attend.
* Discourage full demonstrations in favour of information-complete slide shows
  which takes less time, can be referenced by those interested after the fact
  and can be reused and shared.
* Encourage shorter smoother presentations so that more topics of interest to
  more people can be covered.
* Figure out a way to determine people's interests in topical matters more,
  perhaps noting them down during introductions at meet-ups. Then figure out
  a way to match them with potential speakers. Share with national meet-ups.
* Promote and ask for reporters that may take notes at meet-ups and give a short
  few paragraphs of feedback to Robin for each for our newsletter.

Tasks:

* Lee reports on ongoing efforts to better our video casting. ✔ / ✘
* Ivan reports on general status and requirements for the Johanneburg meet-up.
  ✔ / ✘
* Greg (once we have a website): Provide a form on the website for people to
  submit talks to DASA so they can be pinged for when we need talks. Or for
  people to ask for talks they would like to hear. Look at ways of exposing this
  info and allowing voting systems to float topics to the top. ✔ / ✘
* Everyone: To consider how we can provide these services so that we can
  discuss it more thoroughly at this meeting. ✔ / ✘

Notes:

Completed / Agreed: ✔ / ✘

Notes:

Durban
------
*≈ 10 min*

* Planned to start in 2015. Early potential date 11 February, the second
  Wednesday in February.
* Try to get at least two JHB and two CT people to attend.

Tasks:

* Riaan and Lance maintains a list of potential attendees on a DASA Google Doc
  kept there because it contains people's personal details. Only one person on
  the list so far. ✔ / ✘

  so that we can collect attendees in the mean time. ✔ / ✘

compiled a list of 30 Durban webshops that we can invite to the meetup. Anyone

Notes:

Completed / Agreed: ✔ / ✘


Other
-----
*≈ 5 min*

Review

* We'll first focus on South Africa before considering Southern Africa.
* Once Durban is up, we'll ping the network for demand to determine other
  locations.

Notes:

Completed / Agreed: ✔ / ✘


Business Topics
---------------
*≈ 20 min*

* Look at business discussions at meet-ups: How to cost projects, project
  management, learning management and training, etc
* Also requested in Cape Town

Notes:

Completed / Agreed: ✔ / ✘


DrupalCamp 2015
---------------
*≈ 20 min*

Tasks:

* Riaan to visit Business Connection to see the venue. ✔
* Riaan to draw up a speculative schedule and dates to circulate to core@ for
  contributions and refinement. ✔
* Everyone: Comment critically on the speculative schedule adding thoughts and
  ideas. ✔ / ✘
* Lee: Feedback from H4H (Schalk). ✔ / ✘

Tasks (later):

* Consider keynote speakers (local and international). ✔ / ✘
* Contact Monique, Ivan etc. for potential sponsors (NWU, UJ). ✔ / ✘
* Build on Robin's first estimates for costs (Venues, Displays, Recording,
  Catering, Accommodation, Travel). ✔ / ✘
* Can we sponsor or subsidize travel for a few from CT/DBN. Speakers?
   ✔ / ✘
* Should we have an attendance fee? ✔ / ✘

Riaan reports: Visited Adam at Business Connection on Wed 25 Jun. Venue is
perfect and includes AV equipped Auditorium for 250, 2 medium boardrooms ideal
for BoF sessions (≈ 10 seated and 20 standing), 2 smaller boardrooms, ample safe
parking, careering facilities with good food and loads of space for the hallway
track.

Riaan reports: Drew up the speculative schedule, but it would appear to be a lot
more work than can be covered at the existing DASA meetings and may involve more
or different people. Perhaps we can arrange another Wednesday of the month for
DrupalCamp planning?

Notes:

Completed / Agreed: ✔ / ✘


dasa.org.za Website
-------------------
*≈ 30 min*

Tasks:

* General: Go as far as moving the next meeting date to accommodate the presence
  of all governing board members for this discussion.

Notes left here from previous Agendas so we can work on this:

Riaan (motivation from two meetings ago):

This [BlackTie Spot Agency](http://www.blacktie.co/2013/10/spot-freelance-agency-theme/)
Jekyll theme we have going really limits my ability to participate on the
website. I can do a bit of content editing, but without Sass, for example,
I'm unlikely to be able to work on it extensively considering I do not even
take on well paid work if source isn't up to perfect coding standard, yes,
even indents. I think we'll need at least one of the following:

* Someone knowledgeable of the platform prepared to develop the site more
  actively, a webmaster, effectively.
* At least a better Jekyll theme/structure - perhaps our own. (I can probably
  tackle this).
* To use Drupal which, considering the association we're running, we all have
  some talent in.

* New Drupal-based option in the works.

* Make a final decision on the platform to use. General favour leans towards
  using a Drupal system. We will have a final vote at the June (now July)
  meeting. Leaving discussion open for Ivan to tackle the Jekkyl issue if he
  would like.

* No decision has been made yet. All members of the board MUST be present to
  have a discussion and make a decision on the matter. If the meeting must be
  moved to accommodate this, then that will need to happen.

To Add (one we have a website):

* For mid-term membership upgrade the new memberships are issued for another
  year, credited by the remaining value from the previous membership.
* MailChimp: Add widgets: http://connect.mailchimp.com

Notes:

Completed / Agreed: ✔ / ✘


Advertising
-----------

* We need to start considering advertising options.

Tasks:

* Robin to consider options for a full page ad promoting Drupal and an active
  local community enticing new developers to pick Drupal as a career path, web
  shops to consider Drupal as a focus etc. and promoting the national meet-ups.
  ✔ / ✘
* Riaan to get some pricing for ads in PC Format. ✔
* Everyone to consider their information sources of preference for additional
  options to advertise through. ✔ / ✘

Riaan reports: PC Format will stop local publication. Stuff rate for full page
is R 29 700. Also consider Google Ads.

Notes:

Completed / Agreed: ✔ / ✘

Small Business Interests
------------------------
*≈ 20 min*

Lauro presents a new service DASA may be able to help small business Drupal
shops with that may have a greater supporting effect for the rest of the Drupal
community too. Our first community requested service may deal with supporting
Drupal shops on how address non-performing clients. In this first example the
non-performing client appears to be a serial problem that affected several
Drupal shops already.

Lauro reports:

Notes:

Completed / Agreed: ✔ / ✘


Any Other Business
------------------
*≈ 20 min*

* Anything arising at the meeting or not on the agenda.
* Go around the table asking each attendee if they have any other business they
  want to address.

Completed / Agreed: ✔ / ✘
