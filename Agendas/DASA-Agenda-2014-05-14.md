Governing Board Elections
-------------------------
*≈ 20 min*

* Use [Borda Count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count)
* Pick date for elections. Current board was announced November 2013.
    * Results should be published in October
    * Voting should close end of September
    * Voting in September
    * Promoting upcoming vote in August
* Plan to promoite participation, perhaps through an early text vote open to the community/members.
* [Constitutionn](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DYY133KEg320wm4mIIBMDMd8f31LpndEimysmFUe6oU) requires:
    * A definition of members
    * At least one governing board member must retire and cannot be a member for 12 months thereafter
    * No governing board member may remain a member for more than three consecutive years

Riaan: Considering that only voting at meetings (and not actual attendance and participation) is what I'll miss and I know I'll still do everything I do now and more and that I trust in the vote of the other people on the current board, I propose that I step down for 12 months.

dasa.org.za Website
-------------------
*≈ 1+ hour*

Notes left here from previous Agenda so we can work on this:

Riaan: This [BlackTie Spot Agency](http://www.blacktie.co/2013/10/spot-freelance-agency-theme/) Jekyll theme we have going really limits my ability to participate on the website. I can do a bit of content editing, but without Sass, for example, I'm unlikely to be able to work on it extensively considering I do not even take on well paid work if source isn't up to perfect coding standard, yes, even indents. I think we'll need at least one of the following:

* Someone knowledgeable of the platform prepared to develop the site more actively, a webmaster, effectively.
* At least a better Jekyll theme/structure - perhaps our own. (I can probably tackle this).
* To use Drupal which, considering the association we're running, we all have some talent in.

Topics:

* Front Page: Slogan, Vision, Mission

  Adam reports: Adam needs help with committing to the GitHub of dasa.org.za. Ivan will help.

* Front Page: Community

  Links to meet-ups of each geographic group on meetup.com

  Robin reports: No update this evening, will review next month.

* About: Who we are

  Lance reports: Please accept my pull-request Ivan.

* About: The team

  Everyone reports: Riaan and Lance have updated their details. Greg, Lee, Adam, Robin and Ivan are still to complete.

* About: How will we help

  Greg reports: Working on this at the Easter weekend.

* Membership: Options

  Riaan reports: Added options but we should probably discuss how people sign up as members and add that to the site too. Then add a members list here too once we have some.

* Membership: Where does the money go:

  Riaan reports:

  * Added basic content, check if it is okay like that.
  * Should we add method to become a member text - pay to our account and send us reference with name, surname and e-mail address? Company / personal link? Yes, Riaan must do this.

* News

  Lee reports: No news is good news. Will add a story about DASA meeting Acquia. Riaan will source a photo for Lee.

* Community: Meet-ups list and attendance

  Contact list with e-mails, names only published.

  Robin & Ivan reports: Nothing has been done yet. Postponed to next month.

* Membership: List donations (monetary and incidental)

  Riaan reports: As above, but perhaps it should be it's own section on the page.

* Add links to the shared calendars, so that people can subscribe

  Lee reports: Will do when I get to the above.

* Membership: Benefits of membership

  Consider DA's content.

  Riaan reports: Will review the list from the Drupal Association and advise. Lance has already added some content in this regard.

On GitHub:

* How-to for contributing to the website (in markdown)

  Ivan reports: Ivan will write a basic How To before the next Association Meeting.

Notes: Fail of a month, but we've all been busy. Next month has a few holidays, which could go either way.

Completed / Agreed: ✔
