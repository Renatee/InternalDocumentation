Add more incidental donations as we recall them, perhaps Jason's time to help organise the CT meet-ups?

Regarding cost for potentially useless card: Riaan: I can donate for the costs for the year for the card (probabbly less costly for me than the time to go cancel it) and sans card the account may generate other/additional fees which come free with the card.
