Completed / Agreed:  ✔ / ✘



dasa.org.za Website
-------------------
*≈ 30 min*

Items to add to the website:

* Membership: To upgrade, new memberships are issued for another year, credited by the remaining value from the previous membership.
* MailChimp: Add widgets: http://connect.mailchimp.com

Notes left here from previous Agenda so we can work on this:

Riaan: This [BlackTie Spot Agency](http://www.blacktie.co/2013/10/spot-freelance-agency-theme/) Jekyll theme we have going really limits my ability to participate on the website. I can do a bit of content editing, but without Sass, for example, I'm unlikely to be able to work on it extensively considering I do not even take on well paid work if source isn't up to perfect coding standard, yes, even indents. I think we'll need at least one of the following:

* Someone knowledgeable of the platform prepared to develop the site more actively, a webmaster, effectively.
* At least a better Jekyll theme/structure - perhaps our own. (I can probably tackle this).
* To use Drupal which, considering the association we're running, we all have some talent in.

* New Drupal-based option in the works.

Notes: Make a final decision on the platform to use. General favour leans towards using a Drupal system. We will have a final vote at the June meeting. Leaving discussion open for Ivan to tackle the Jekkyl issue if he would like.

Completed / Agreed: ✔ / ✘


Any Other Business
------------------
*≈ 20 min*

Anything arising at the meeting or not on the agenda. Go around the table asking each attendee if they have any other business they want to address.
