Drupal Association South Africa
===============================

Document Status
---------------

* Until 2 weeks before the meeting: Anyone freely adds notes and filler or place-holder text. Edit as much as needed. Make sure to look at the last few meetings' agendas and notes that serve as minutes to see if we address all matters.

* 2 Weeks before the meeting: Start fleshing out any filler text. Note incomplete text that need more information. We want to try to make sure everyone knows what will be said at the meeting without any surprises. Surprises makes for poor decision making.

* 1 Week before the meeting: Seriously note any unclear text from anyone. Complete any content and start reviewing content from others to get up to speed with issues.

* 1/2 Days before the meeting, remove any unclear elements of filler text or notes that just say that more information will follow at the meeting. Clean up and complete.

* After the meeting: Nothing but formatting changes.

Anyone else get time to do this or something similar? Richard? Sure I heard you mention something - but it could have been the Sambucca...
