Drupal Association South Africa
===============================

Document Status
---------------

* Until 2 weeks before the meeting: Anyone freely adds notes and filler or place-holder text. Edit as much as needed. Make sure to look at the last few meetings' agendas and notes that serve as minutes to see if we address all matters.

* 2 Weeks before the meeting: Start fleshing out any filler text. Note incomplete text that need more information. We want to try to make sure everyone knows what will be said at the meeting without any surprises. Surprises makes for poor decision making.

* 1 Week before the meeting: Seriously note any unclear text from anyone. Complete any content and start reviewing content from others to get up to speed with issues.

* 1/2 Days before the meeting, remove any unclear elements of filler text or notes that just say that more information will follow at the meeting. Clean up and complete.

* After the meeting: Nothing but formatting changes.

Website Content
---------------
*≈ 15 min*

Monique reports: On content other associations and the main DA hosts on their websites and perhaps ideas of what we can host.

Riaan: I've not had time to familiarise myself with the Jekyll website, how to participate in content generation and to then add a how-to to the website to make it easier for others. Anyone else get time to do this or something similar? Richard? Sure I heard you mention something - but it could have been the Sambucca...

Notes: Focus on building the website, on the 19th March. A base layout is currently available at http://dasa.org.za to provide some aspects we want to illustrate.

Topics:
* Vision
* Mission
* Community
* Sponsors
* Who are we
* The team
* How will we help?
* Membership packages
* Where does the money go?
* News

Reporter and Backup: None, assign sections at the next meeting. Have the vision and mission signed off: https://groups.drupal.org/node/405223

Attendance Register for Meet-ups
--------------------------------
*≈ 15 min*

Riaan/Ivan reports: Newly available attendance registers on dasa.org.za and how they can be used.

Notes: Open for discussion at the next meetup. Maybe at the next group-meetup, discuss how the community wants to use the registers?
Ideas:
* List members who attend meetups
* Gain e-mail addresses to connect with community members, follow up on meetups, newsletters, etc
* Stats at the end of the year

Voting via GitHub
-----------------
*≈ 10 min*

Everyone reports: On issue queue usability for voting. Any idea on voting at the AGM etc. Ideas of verifying SA involvement of individuals who vote and methods to prevent abuse. Ideas of engaging people to get as many as possible of eligible Drupal people to vote.

Notes:
* Document the process on the website
* Happy with GitHub
* Someone needs to be assigned to tally the results - Adam
* South African verification will be difficult, in the long run we will have registered members, and we can also use the attendance register. Maybe you have to attend a meetup atleast once before you can vote?
* Engage people to vote via e-mail lists, newsletters, groups.drupal, website, and other.

Reporter and Backup: Adam

Durban
------
*≈ 20 min*

Riaan reports: On Durbs' state. Ian's availability and possible reboot needed for Durbs.

* Please clarify, postponed until next meetup with an agenda.

* Plans are underway to setup the first meetup (hopefully before the next DASA meetup), and use it as a platform to gain commitment to have monthly meetups.
